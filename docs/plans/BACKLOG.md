# MFS-Operations — Backlog

Single living index for everything deferred. If we said "we'll do it later"
and didn't have a roadmap slot, it lands here. If it's in here, we won't
forget it. Each entry points to where the detail lives.

**Conventions:**

- **F-TD-** prefix = tech debt (numbered, claimable as its own PR)
- **F-PROD-** prefix = product feature (not part of hexagonal migration)
- **ARCH-FU-** prefix = architecture follow-up (deferred from an ADR or plan)
- **F-INFRA-** prefix = test/deploy infrastructure unit (numbered, claimable as its own PR)
- Date on each entry = when it was deferred (so age is visible)
- Owner-unit = the migration unit that will absorb the fix, or `unscheduled`
- Status: `open` / `in-progress (<unit>)` / `done (<PR>)` / `obsolete`

When closing an item, leave the entry in place and change status to
`done (<PR>)` so the history stays readable. Don't delete entries —
the trail matters.

## Tech debt (F-TD-)

### F-TD-01 — Clear pre-existing tsc + ESLint nits

- **Deferred:** 2026-06-07 (during F-FND-02)
- **What:** ~60 pre-existing `tsc --noEmit` errors + ESLint nits across `app/admin/**`, `app/haccp/**`, `app/pricing/**`, `components/**`.
- **Why deferred:** out of scope for the foundation unit that surfaced them.
- **Goal:** `npm run lint` and `npx tsc --noEmit` both exit 0 on main. Once landed, ANVIL drops the calibrated-pass criteria on layers 3+4 — strict exit-0 becomes default.
- **Detail:** `docs/architecture-review-2026-06-06.md` line 383
- **Owner unit:** F-TD-01 (dedicated PR — may be multiple commits)
- **Status:** open

### F-TD-03 — Fix 23 broken Orders HTTP integration tests

- **Deferred:** 2026-06-09 (during F-06)
- **What:** 23 integration tests in `tests/integration/orders/**` fail because they require `npm run dev` running separately to hit the Next.js dev server via the `api()` helper. F-INFRA-01 didn't auto-boot the dev server for integration runs.
- **Why deferred:** F-06's contract tests use the direct-adapter pattern and bypass the broken HTTP layer entirely. F-07 doesn't touch routes.
- **Detail:** `docs/anvil/2026-06-09-f-06-cert.md` §F-TD-03 + F-06 plan §10. Root cause confirmed 2026-06-09: no auto-booted dev server (every failure is connection-refused on port 3000); the documented manual `npm run dev` procedure would wire the server to PRODUCTION Supabase — live-data hazard. Failure count now 30/92 (suite grew since the 23/49 snapshot).
- **Owner unit:** **F-08 hard prerequisite** — F-08 cannot ship until these pass
- **Status:** done (PR #25 / `58b1168` — self-contained runner, 92/92 green; cert `docs/anvil/2026-06-10-f-td-03-cert.md`)

### F-TD-04 — `lib/supabase.ts` eager `createClient` at module load

- **Deferred:** 2026-06-09 (during F-07, loop 2)
- **What:** `lib/supabase.ts:15` calls `createClient(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!, ...)` at module-load time. Every file that transitively imports it (every supabase adapter, every service that wires a singleton) forces env-var validation on import — INCLUDING unit tests that use Fake adapters and never touch the real client.
- **Why deferred:** F-07 hit this when its singleton import broke `npm test` on a clean clone. We patched it with Option C (vitest setupFiles stubs the env vars before test load); the root cause is still there. Option B — refactor `lib/supabase.ts` to a lazy `getSupabaseService()` getter — is the architecturally correct fix but touches every supabase adapter file (6 files).
- **Goal:** `lib/supabase.ts` exports `getSupabaseService()` lazy factory. All adapters call the getter inside method bodies. Module-load is env-clean.
- **Detail:** F-07 plan §5 Risk #7 (updated) + F-07 cert (when written)
- **Also (from F-09 audit, 2026-06-11):** when the lazy-getter fix lands, ALSO move `lib/supabase.ts` → `lib/adapters/supabase/client.ts` so all Supabase code lives inside the one adapter folder (today the shared client is Supabase code living outside the box labelled Supabase).
- **Owner unit:** unscheduled — pick up after Phase 1 closes (F-09)
- **Status:** done (PR #35 / squash `e0c5fcd`, shipped + prod-verified 2026-06-14). Full close: new lazy `lib/adapters/supabase/client.ts` (`getSupabaseService()` memoized + back-compat `supabaseService` lazy Proxy → zero `createClient` at module-load), codemod of 88 import paths, deleted old `lib/supabase.ts` + the `tests/setup.ts` env-stub shim, synced 4 lint mirrors. Acceptance proof: unit 1533→1536 green with the shim gone (`setup 0ms`); integration 122; preview 8/8; prod smoke 5/5 non-500 (`kds/orders` 200 through the proxy). No migration. Cert `docs/anvil/2026-06-14-f-td-04-lazy-supabase-client-cert.md`. Residual 🟡 → F-TD-17 (WebKit E2E flake, harness not app).

### F-TD-05 — Architecture-pin test only covers `OrdersService.ts`

- **Deferred:** 2026-06-09 (during F-07, loop 1 — code-critic TS-03)
- **What:** `tests/unit/services/OrdersService.test.ts` test #28 reads ONLY `lib/services/OrdersService.ts` and asserts no cross-service / observability / auth / log imports. When `UsersService.ts` ships, this test will still pass even if UsersService imports OrdersService directly.
- **Why deferred:** F-07 is the first service; pin trivially passes today.
- **Fix shape:** convert the test to read every file in `lib/services/`, OR convert to an ESLint `no-restricted-imports` rule (cleaner — fails at lint not at test time).
- **Detail:** F-07 cert + code-critic Guard report (when cert written)
- **Owner unit:** F-13 (UsersService) — must tighten BEFORE second service ships
- **Progress (2026-06-12, F-TD-11):** adapter-import dimension now ESLint-enforced for `lib/services/**` + `lib/usecases/**` (`.eslintrc.json` override, pinned by `tests/unit/lint/no-adapter-imports.test.ts` against the real config); cross-service-import dimension still open — owner F-13 unchanged.
- **Status:** done (F-13 PR1, `7d482c6`) — cross-service-import ban added to the services/usecases ESLint override (`no-restricted-imports` patterns `@/lib/services/*` + `**/services/*`, catching the alias form the codebase universally uses; same-dir `./Other` relative deliberately left legal so the `lib/services/index.ts` barrel re-export passes — documented 🔵 gap), pinned by load-from-disk test `tests/unit/lint/no-cross-service-imports.test.ts` (verified it bites on a real cross-service import).

### F-TD-06 — `ValidationError` comma-joined string shape (`{ "lines.products": ["a, b, c"] }`)

- **Deferred:** 2026-06-09 (during F-07, loop 1 — code-critic CV-02)
- **What:** Service emits N missing product IDs as a SINGLE comma-joined string inside a single-element array. The `ValidationError.fields` contract says `Record<string, string[]>` — the array is supposed to be a LIST of error messages, not a list of IDs masquerading as one string. Routes/UI can't easily render "first ID X, second Y" from `["X, Y, Z"]`; splitting on `, ` is fragile.
- **Why deferred:** F-07 plan §1 locked the comma-join shape at Gate 2; changing it needs a plan amendment.
- **Fix shape:** emit one entry per missing ID: `{ "lines.products": missing.map(id => `Unknown product id: ${id}`) }` — array length matches count.
- **Detail:** F-07 plan §1 + code-critic Guard report
- **Owner unit:** F-08 — natural to fix when routes adopt the service (routes can rely on cleaner array shape)
- **Status:** done (F-08 PR — `placeOrder`/`editOrder` emit one `Unknown product id: <id>` entry per missing id; unit + integration tests pin the shape)

### F-TD-07 — Production hygiene check for leftover `ANVIL-TEST-*` rows

- **Deferred:** 2026-06-09 (during F-TD-03 planning)
- **What:** Before F-TD-03, the documented integration-test procedure booted the dev server against `.env.local` (production Supabase). Any past run that followed it may have written `ANVIL-TEST-*` fixture rows (users, customer, orders) into the PRODUCTION database via the dev server. One-off audit: query production for `name LIKE 'ANVIL-TEST-%'` across `users`, `customers`, `products` and orders referencing them; review findings with Hakan before deleting anything.
- **Why deferred:** F-TD-03 is forbidden from touching production (scope boundary locked at Gate 1).
- **Detail:** `docs/plans/2026-06-09-f-td-03-integration-test-runner.md` (Risks)
- **Owner unit:** Day 4 of the 16-day sprint
- **Status:** done (2026-06-15 — read-only prod audit, **0 fixture rows** found across `users`/`customers`/`products` + linked orders; exact `ANVIL-TEST-%` + widened `anvil/e2e/fixture/test/sentinel` sweep, live-data sanity counts confirm real reads. No delete needed. Record `docs/anvil/2026-06-15-f-td-07-anvil-test-row-audit.md`)

### F-TD-08 — `kds.test.ts` clobbers ANVIL-TEST-butcher's `pin_hash` (breaks subsequent local `@critical` runs)

- **Deferred:** 2026-06-10 (during F-INFRA-02 Guard)
- **What:** `tests/integration/kds.test.ts:22,36-37` overwrites ANVIL-TEST-butcher's `pin_hash` with a bcrypt of its own committed plaintext PIN (`'8129'`) and never restores it (`cleanupTestData` only deletes orders). Pre-existing on main; impact activated by F-INFRA-02's freshly-minted `E2E_PIN_BUTCHER`: any local `@critical` Playwright run AFTER `npm run test:integration` fails at spec 03 until `npm run db:reset`.
- **Fix shape:** derive the test's PIN from `E2E_PIN_BUTCHER`, or restore the original `pin_hash` in `afterAll`.
- **Detail:** code-critic Guard report for PR #26 (W3) + `docs/plans/2026-06-10-f-infra-02-preview-smoke-plumbing.md`
- **Owner unit:** Day 1 of the 16-day sprint
- **Status:** done (`tests/integration/kds.test.ts` captures the butcher's original `pin_hash` in `beforeAll` and restores it in `afterAll`; verified from a clean baseline — post-run hash restored to sentinel, no `bcrypt('8129')` residue)

### F-TD-09 — Scheduled purge of expired `order_idempotency_keys` rows

- **Deferred:** 2026-06-11 (during F-08)
- **What:** the `order_idempotency_keys` ledger (migration `20260611_001`) expires rows after 24h at READ time and reclaims them opportunistically when an expired key is reused — but nothing sweeps rows whose key is never reused. At this system's order volume the table grows by a handful of rows a day, so this is hygiene, not a hazard.
- **Fix shape:** a tiny scheduled job (pg_cron or a `/api/cron` route) running `DELETE FROM order_idempotency_keys WHERE expires_at < now()` daily.
- **Also absorbs (code-critic Guard findings on PR #27, all non-blocking):**
  - **W1 (TOCTOU at the expiry boundary):** `lib/adapters/supabase/OrdersRepository.ts` `createOrder` step 0 — the expired-key and stale-order reclaim arms delete by `key` alone; a concurrent same-key request can have its fresh row deleted, letting one key resolve to two orders. Only reachable when the same key races itself at the exact 24h boundary — impossible for real double-taps. Fix: make the deletes conditional (`.lte('expires_at', now)` for the expiry arm, `.eq('order_id', existing.order_id)` for the stale-order arm).
  - **N1:** same file, pathological-arm error log includes the raw `idempotencyKey` — log a hash or the order id instead.
  - **N2:** `rollbackOwnOrder` failure is log-only (`[rollbackOwnOrder]` line) — correct trade-off, but that log line is the only alarm for a surviving duplicate; check for it when reviewing logs.
  - **N3:** two comments in `lib/domain/Order.ts` (~234, ~263) still reference the deleted `lib/orders/validation.ts`.
- **Detail:** `docs/plans/2026-06-11-f-08-orders-route-rewrites.md` §5 D1 (TTL / cleanup decision) + code-critic Guard report for PR #27
- **Owner unit:** unscheduled (tiny)
- **Status:** done (PR #34 / squash `29987df`, shipped + prod-verified 2026-06-14). Daily Vercel cron `/api/cron/purge-idempotency-keys` (`0 3 * * *`) → port `purgeExpiredIdempotencyKeys` → adapter `DELETE … WHERE expires_at <= now`. W1 TOCTOU closed (conditional reclaim deletes, one captured `now`); N1 (key dropped from error log) + N3 (stale comments) done; N2 unchanged by design. ANVIL wrote the deferred I2/I3/I4 integration specs (integration 115→122). Cert `docs/anvil/2026-06-14-f-td-09-idempotency-key-hygiene-cert.md`. Residual 🔵 follow-ups → F-TD-16.

### F-TD-10 — Wire `Idempotency-Key` into the order form (activate the F-08 duplicate guard)

- **Deferred:** 2026-06-11 (at F-08 Gate 4, decided by Hakan — ship API-side first)
- **What:** F-08 shipped full server-side idempotent order placement, but no screen sends the header yet — the guard is dormant. `app/orders/new/page.tsx` `handleSubmit` (~line 175) must generate a fingerprint (`crypto.randomUUID()`) when an order submission starts and REUSE it across retries of that same order (the "Network error — please try again" path is the exact duplicate-creating case), resetting only after success or when the user edits the order content.
- **Why deferred:** F-08's locked scope kept screens untouched (wire-format decision); the API contract is complete and tested (replay, race, cross-user, expiry). No regression vs today — only delayed benefit.
- **Fix shape:** ~15 lines in the form + one integration/E2E test proving a retried submit with the same key returns the original order.
- **Detail:** `docs/anvil/2026-06-11-f-08-cert.md` + F-08 plan §10 (optional header)
- **Owner unit:** unscheduled — **next small PR after F-08 merges** (Hakan's call at Gate 4)
- **Status:** done (PR #28 — `lib/orders/idempotencyKey.ts` key source + form wiring; reset on success/edit, reused across retries; unit tests + form-shaped replay integration test)

### F-TD-11 — Single composition root for Orders wiring (F-09 BLOCKER fix)

- **Deferred:** 2026-06-11 (F-09 rip-out audit, BLOCKER-1 — picked up immediately by Hakan's decision)
- **What:** the rip-out test fails 1+4 vs the mandated 1+1: `@/lib/adapters/supabase` is imported by name in four business-logic files — `lib/services/OrdersService.ts:143-147,538-542`, `lib/usecases/pickingList.ts:27-30,120-124`, `lib/usecases/kdsLineDone.ts:25,77-80`, `lib/usecases/kdsQueue.ts:22,71-74` — because the F-07 "factory + pre-wired singleton" template embeds vendor wiring in every service/use-case file. The template is the worked example for every future service; left as-is the wiring-site count grows to ~30 by Phase 5.
- **Fix shape:** one composition-root file (e.g. `lib/wiring/orders.ts`) imports the adapter singletons once and constructs `ordersService` + the three use-case singletons; service/use-case files keep their factories, lose their adapter imports; routes import singletons from the composition root. Same PR: tighten the architecture pin (or an ESLint `no-restricted-imports` rule) to forbid `lib/adapters` imports from `lib/services/**` and `lib/usecases/**` — the current pin codifies rather than catches this pattern (interacts with F-TD-05). ~5 files, zero behaviour change, covered by existing unit suite.
- **Detail:** `docs/anvil/2026-06-11-f-09-rip-out-audit.md` (BLOCKER-1)
- **Owner unit:** F-TD-11 (dedicated PR) — **must land before F-13 clones the template**; F-09 re-gates after it merges
- **Status:** done (PR #29 / `43f5049` — `lib/wiring/orders.ts` composition root + ESLint guard pinned by `tests/unit/lint/no-adapter-imports.test.ts`; rip-out re-enumeration on shipped main = 1 adapter folder + 1 wiring file; F-09 re-gated PASS 2026-06-12 → Phase 1 closed; cert `docs/anvil/2026-06-12-f-td-11-cert.md`)

### F-TD-12 — Retire legacy `lib/orders/types.ts` wire shapes from the UI

- **Deferred:** 2026-06-11 (F-09 rip-out audit, informational note)
- **What:** `lib/orders/types.ts` (legacy DB-mirror wire shapes — app-owned, no SDK content, NOT a Lego violation) is still imported by all 5 Orders/KDS UI pages + `components/EditLockBanner.tsx`. Routes no longer import it; `lib/domain/Order.ts:25-27` records the intent to retire it once nothing does.
- **Fix shape:** move the UI pages to DTO-derived types, then delete `lib/orders/types.ts`.
- **Detail:** `docs/anvil/2026-06-11-f-09-rip-out-audit.md` (item 7 notes)
- **Owner unit:** unscheduled — low priority, fold into the UI phase
- **Status:** open

### F-TD-13 — `annualReview.test.ts` date-boundary flake (00:00–01:00 local)

- **Deferred:** 2026-06-12 (found during F-TD-11 Render; pre-existing on main, unrelated to the diff)
- **What:** 2 `trainingRefreshStatus` tests in `tests/unit/annualReview.test.ts` fail when the suite runs between 00:00 and 01:00 local (BST): the test helper derives "today" via `toISOString()` (UTC) while the implementation (`lib/annualReview/sections.ts`) uses the local date — for one hour a day the two disagree. Verified failing on untouched main at 00:36 and green at 01:00+.
- **Fix shape:** make the test helper derive "today" the same way the implementation does (local date), or freeze the clock in the test with vitest fake timers.
- **Detail:** PR #29 description (implementer note) + `docs/anvil/2026-06-12-f-td-11-cert.md` (known gaps §1)
- **Owner unit:** Day 1 of the 16-day sprint
- **Status:** done (`daysFromToday` helper now derives the date via `toLocaleDateString('en-CA')` — local, matching the implementation and the rest of the file — instead of `toISOString()` UTC; 182/182 unit tests green)

### F-TD-14 — 32 `/api/haccp/*` routes authorize off UNSIGNED `mfs_role`/`mfs_user_id` cookies (T1 residual)

- **Deferred:** 2026-06-12 (during T1 — sign the `mfs_session` cookie; plan §11 risk R6)
- **What:** all 32 route files under `app/api/haccp/**` read the client-writable, unsigned `mfs_role` / `mfs_user_id` cookies directly for authorization (e.g. `app/api/haccp/customers/route.ts:14`), and `/api/haccp` is a PUBLIC path in `middleware.ts` — so these routes never see the now-signed `mfs_session` at all. Signing `mfs_session` (T1) does NOT close this hole: anyone can set `mfs_role=admin` in devtools and call these endpoints. Forgeable independently of the session cookie.
- **Why deferred:** out of T1's locked scope (Gate 1: no change to the unsigned display cookies or the HACCP route authorization model); too big to sneak into the signing PR.
- **Fix shape:** auth-track follow-up unit — move `/api/haccp/*` authorization onto the verified session (middleware `x-mfs-*` headers or a shared `requireRole` helper reading the signed cookie); rides the T4/`requireRole` migration from the F-RLS-01 audit.
- **Detail:** `docs/plans/2026-06-12-t1-sign-session-cookie.md` §11 R6 + `docs/rls-audit-2026-06-12.md`
- **Owner unit:** T4 (auth track) — needs its own unit, not unscheduled hygiene
- **Status:** open

## Architecture follow-ups (ARCH-FU-)

### ARCH-FU-01 — Move `Role` from `lib/observability/` to `lib/domain/`

- **Deferred:** 2026-06-09 (during F-05)
- **What:** `Role` union (`'admin' | 'sales' | 'office' | 'warehouse' | 'butcher' | 'driver'`) currently lives at `lib/observability/Caller.ts:26`. It's a pure domain concept but ended up in the observability layer because F-03 (caller context) needed it first. F-07's OrdersService imports it as a type-only from `@/lib/observability` — small architectural quirk.
- **Why deferred:** moving it now would touch every file that imports it for one symbol's sake; F-13 is where the auth/user domain naturally lands.
- **Fix shape:** create `lib/domain/Role.ts`, re-export from `lib/domain/index.ts`, change every importer's path (one-line each), delete the export from observability.
- **Detail:** `lib/observability/Caller.ts:11-16` + F-07 plan §1.5
- **Owner unit:** F-13 (UsersService — naturally touches Role anyway)
- **Status:** done (F-13 PR1, `7d482c6`) — `lib/domain/Role.ts` created (Role union + `KNOWN_ROLES` + `isKnownRole`), re-exported from `lib/domain/index.ts`, every importer re-pointed, observability export deleted, `UserSummary.role` tightened from `string` to the `Role` union. tsc 0 proves no orphaned import.
- **F-13 note (added 2026-06-11, F-08):** F-08 shipped a minimal read-only `UsersRepository` port (`lib/ports/UsersRepository.ts`, `findUserById` only) with Supabase + Fake adapters and a shared contract suite. **F-13 absorbs and expands this port** — it is the Users domain's absorption seed; `UserSummary.role` (plain `string`) tightens to the `Role` union when Role moves to `lib/domain/`.

### ARCH-FU-02 — Raw `fetch()` sites awaiting port extractions (F-01 narrowing)

- **Deferred:** 2026-06-08 (during F-01)
- **What:** 13 raw `fetch()` call sites identified in F-01's grill were NOT migrated in F-01 because they need port extractions that don't exist yet. Each is assigned to a future migration unit.
- **Why deferred:** narrowing F-01 to one rule kept the unit shippable.
- **Detail:** `docs/adr/0005-f01-narrowed-raw-fetch-deferred-to-port-extractions.md` (Per-Site Map of 13 sites with owners)
- **Owner units:** F-11, F-15, F-16, F-17, F-18, F-20 (distributed)
- **Status:** open (owner-tracked, not a single unit)

### ARCH-FU-03 — `editOrder` unused `callerUserId` parameter

- **Deferred:** 2026-06-09 (during F-07, loop 1 — code-critic CV-01)
- **What:** `OrdersService.editOrder(id, patch, lineReplacement, callerRole, callerUserId)` takes `callerUserId` but doesn't use it. Documented as forward-compat for F-13 (audit) / F-19 (edit history). Implementation destructures it as `_callerUserId`.
- **Why deferred:** F-07 plan §1 included it as forward-compat; harmless dead arg today.
- **Decision needed:** when F-13/F-19 lands — either (a) wire it through to a new audit hook, or (b) remove it from the interface and add fresh fields when actually needed (YAGNI argument).
- **Detail:** F-07 source `lib/services/OrdersService.ts:417` + plan §1 lines 268-272
- **Owner unit:** F-13 or F-19 (whichever ships first and adopts the audit shape)
- **Status:** done (F-13 PR1, `7d482c6`) — chose **(b) YAGNI-remove** (Hakan-approved at Frame): F-13 is a pure extraction with no audit-trail feature, so the dead `callerUserId` was removed from `editOrder`'s signature/impl/JSDoc + the single route call site + 8 test call sites. When F-19 (edit history) needs audit it adds fresh, used fields then.

### ARCH-FU-04 — Improve unit-test happy-path coverage with round-trip reads

- **Deferred:** 2026-06-09 (during F-07, loop 1 — code-critic SU-02)
- **What:** F-07's `placeOrder` happy-path test asserts the return value's shape but doesn't round-trip through `findOrderById` to confirm persistence. A bug where `createOrder` returns a well-shaped Order without persisting would pass.
- **Why deferred:** non-blocker; F-07's other tests catch the persistence path indirectly.
- **Fix shape:** one-line `const fresh = await service.findOrderById(result.id); expect(fresh?.reference).toBe(result.reference);` after happy-path assertions, in every service's unit test.
- **Detail:** F-07 cert (when written) + code-critic Guard report
- **Owner unit:** F-13 (template for service unit tests) — apply pattern, retrofit OrdersService.test.ts
- **Status:** done (F-13 PR1, `7d482c6`) — round-trip read-back adopted in the UsersRepository shared contract (write then re-read via the finder, assert persistence) + retrofitted into OrdersService.test.ts happy-paths. It is now the documented template for service unit tests.

### ARCH-FU-05 — Test forbidden-role exclusion paths in `editOrder`

- **Deferred:** 2026-06-09 (during F-07, loop 1 — code-critic SU-03)
- **What:** F-07's `editOrder` tests cover roles that ARE allowed but not roles that AREN'T. No test asserts `warehouse`/`butcher`/`driver` are blocked from editing a placed order. Today's behaviour blocks them; if `ROLES_EDIT_PLACED` is accidentally edited to include one of them, no test catches it.
- **Fix shape:** parametrised `it.each(['warehouse', 'butcher', 'driver'])` case in editOrder describe block.
- **Detail:** F-07 cert (when written) + code-critic Guard report
- **Owner unit:** unscheduled — pickup at F-08 when routes go live (good time to harden), or F-13 (template).
- **Status:** done (F-08 PR — `it.each(['warehouse','butcher','driver'])` placed-state ForbiddenError cases in `tests/unit/services/OrdersService.test.ts`)

---

## Migration hygiene (F-TD-)

### F-TD-15 — Migration filename convention collides for same-day migrations

- **Deferred:** 2026-06-13 (during T3)
- **What:** The repo's `YYYYMMDD_NNN_name.sql` naming is latent-broken — the Supabase CLI derives a migration's `version` from the digits **before the first underscore**, so `20260613_001_…` and `20260613_002_…` both register as version `20260613` and collide (`schema_migrations_pkey` 23505) on `db:reset`. Never surfaced because every prior date had exactly one migration; T3 was the first second-same-day migration and hit it.
- **Fix applied for T3:** T3 uses a full 14-digit timestamp `20260613020000_harden_security_definer_fns.sql` (unique version, sorts after T2). Going forward all migrations should use full 14-digit timestamps (`YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_name.sql`, like `20260101000000_baseline.sql`), not `YYYYMMDD_NNN`.
- **Escalation 2026-06-15:** the drift had a second, worse consequence than the same-day collision — it broke **Supabase preview-branch resync**. On a PR's 2nd+ push the CLI diffs the branch's recorded 8-digit versions against the local files and fails (`Remote migration versions not found in local migrations directory` → branch `status=MIGRATIONS_FAILED`), which fail-closes any health-gated workflow (preview smoke, F-INFRA-05 cred-sync) and blocked F-RLS-04a. Discovered live on PR #39.
- **Residual work — now done (F-TD-15 residual (a) + (b), 2026-06-15):**
  - **(b) files renamed:** the 4 short-named files renamed to full 14-digit (`git mv`, byte-identical): `20260530_001_…`→`20260530000000_…`, `20260601_001_…`→`20260601000000_…`, `20260611_001_…`→`20260611000000_…`, `20260613_001_…`→`20260613000000_…`. Order preserved (`…613000000` < existing `…613020000`). Live references repointed (ADR-0007, the 16-day roadmap, `lib/adapters/supabase/OrdersRepository.ts`, `lib/orders/types.ts`).
  - **(a) convention codified:** the full-14-digit rule is written into CLAUDE.md ("Local test infrastructure") and **pinned by `tests/unit/migrations/filename-convention.test.ts`** (asserts every migration filename matches `/^\d{14}_[a-z0-9_]+\.sql$/`, rejects a known-bad name, and bars duplicate version prefixes).
- **Descoped → moved to F-TD-18:** the originally-proposed reconciliation of **prod** `schema_migrations` was **dropped from this unit** — proven inert (preview branches build from the repo's migration FILES, not prod's recorded history; prod is append-only via `apply_migration`). Logged as optional future hygiene under **F-TD-18**.
- **Detail:** `docs/plans/2026-06-15-f-td-15-migration-filename-reconciliation.md`; original collision context in `docs/plans/2026-06-13-t3-harden-security-definer-fns.md` §"Exact file to change".
- **Priority:** Medium → resolved.
- **Owner unit:** F-TD-15 residual (b) (2026-06-15).
- **Status:** done (F-TD-15 residual (a) + (b) — files renamed to 14-digit, convention codified in CLAUDE.md and pinned by `tests/unit/migrations/filename-convention.test.ts`; prod-history reconciliation descoped to F-TD-18).

### F-TD-18 — Prod migration-history reconciliation (optional hygiene)

- **Logged:** 2026-06-15 (split out of F-TD-15 residual (b))
- **What:** Prod `schema_migrations` (project uqgecljspgtevoylwkep) holds ~100 real historical records with full-14-digit timestamps and NO baseline row, whereas the repo ships 7 squashed migration files. The two histories diverge.
- **Why INERT for our workflow:** Supabase preview branches are built from the repo's migration FILES (verified on branch htinhqorvyhajcsvnqgz — it recorded exactly the 7 repo-file versions, not prod's ~100). Prod itself is only ever mutated via `apply_migration` (append-only); we never run `supabase db push` or `supabase db pull` against prod. So the divergence touches no live path — it is NOT on the RLS critical path and does not affect preview-branch health.
- **Optional future fix:** if we ever adopt `db push`/`db pull` against prod, reconcile prod's recorded history with the repo (mechanism TBD: `supabase migration repair` vs direct `schema_migrations` edit). Own FORGE/ANVIL pass, prod-touching.
- **⚠️ HARD GATE:** this MUST land **before** any switch to a diff-based prod migration workflow (`supabase db push`/`db pull`). Under that workflow the renamed 14-digit files would be seen as NEW (prod recorded the old short versions) and re-applied → failure/double-apply. Inert only while prod stays append-only via `apply_migration`. Confirmed live 2026-06-15: F-TD-15 shipped (`b3f3901`) with prod untouched; preview branches build fresh from files (proven on `uiiubqaxnjvjaoqicvau`).
- **Priority:** LOW — optional hygiene, off the critical path (but a blocking prereq for any diff-based prod sync, per the gate above).
- **Status:** open (no scheduled owner).

### F-TD-19 — `findUserByName` literal-vs-wildcard twin divergence (🔵 from F-13 PR1 Guard)

- **Logged:** 2026-06-15 (F-13 PR1 code-critic review, 🔵)
- **What:** the two `UsersRepository` adapters match names differently: Supabase `findUserByName` uses `ilike` (`lib/adapters/supabase/UsersRepository.ts:126`), which treats `%`/`_` as SQL wildcards; the Fake uses exact lowercase equality (`lib/adapters/fake/UsersRepository.ts:152-158`), which doesn't. For every committed consumer (literal staff names, no wildcards) the twins behave identically; they'd diverge silently ONLY if a caller passed a name containing a SQL wildcard char.
- **Fix shape:** one-line port-doc note that names are treated as literals, OR make the Supabase adapter escape `%`/`_` before the `ilike` so the twins match for wildcard-bearing input. No consumer sends such input today → not a bug, hygiene only.
- **Priority:** LOW (theoretical edge; no live path).
- **Status:** open.

### F-TD-20 — `PATCH /api/admin/users/[id]` returns 500 (not 404) for a missing id

- **Logged:** 2026-06-15 (F-13 PR2, R-MF-1 — latent bug deliberately preserved)
- **What:** editing a non-existent user id returns `500 { error: 'User not found' }`, not a `404`. Historically the route used `.update(...).select(...).single()`, and PostgREST's `.single()` errors (`PGRST116`) on a zero-row UPDATE → the route's `if (error)` path emitted 500. PR1's `updateUser` adapter uses `.maybeSingle()` and returns `null` on no-row. To keep PR2 a pure no-behaviour-change re-point, the re-pointed route maps that `null` to the SAME 500 (`app/api/admin/users/[id]/route.ts` PATCH handler). Pinned by `tests/integration/admin-users.test.ts` ("PATCH missing-id returns 500").
- **Fix shape:** change the `null` branch to `404 { error: 'User not found' }` (semantically correct) — a deliberate status-code change (500→404) that belongs in its own small unit, not a re-pointing PR. Update the integration pin from 500 to 404 at the same time, and check the admin UI handles a 404 from the toggle/reset/secondary-role flows.
- **Priority:** LOW (error path only; missing-id PATCH is not a live happy path).
- **Status:** open.

### F-TD-22 — `users.name` uniqueness guard (case-insensitive) — ✅ SHIPPED 2026-06-16 (PR #46, `1f46857`)

- **Logged:** 2026-06-16 (F-13 PR3 Guard, 🟡 W1). **Hakan explicitly wants this enforced** — not a someday-maybe.
- **What:** there is no uniqueness constraint on `users.name` and no app-level guard on user creation, while the login lookup is case-insensitive (`.ilike("name", …)`). So `"Hakan"` and `"hakan"` (or two identical names) can coexist. PR3 surfaced this as a behaviour delta: the old `.single()` returned `401 Invalid credentials` (+ `recordFailure`) on a duplicate-name lookup; the new adapter `.maybeSingle()` errors on >1 row → route returns `500 'Database error'` and `recordFailure` does NOT fire. Operator-error edge, accepted for PR3.
- **Fix shape (own small FORGE unit, needs a migration):**
  1. **Dedup FIRST** — a unique index FAILS to create if duplicate names already exist in prod, so pre-flight: query prod for any case-insensitive name collisions and resolve them before applying.
  2. Add a **`UNIQUE` index on `lower(name)`** (catches case variants, matching the `.ilike` lookup) — NOT a plain unique on `name`.
  3. Add an app-level guard (clear error) on user create/rename so the DB error surfaces as a friendly 4xx, not a 500.
  4. Decide whether the login duplicate-name 500 path is then unreachable (it should be) and simplify if so.
- **Priority:** MEDIUM (data-integrity + closes the PR3 W1 edge). **Owner unit:** dedicated, scheduled after F-13 (alongside / before F-RLS-04b).
- **Shipped as:** UNIQUE index on `lower(name)` (migration `20260616120000_unique_username_lower_index`, covers all rows active+inactive); both adapters trim name on write + map Postgres `23505` → app-owned `ConflictError`; `POST /api/admin/users` → 409 "A user with that name already exists." Verify-first prod dedup found **0** collisions (11 users, 11 distinct). The login duplicate-name 500/W1 path is now unreachable (names are unique) — login adapter/route needed NO change. Cert `docs/anvil/2026-06-16-f-td-22-unique-usernames-cert.md`; review `docs/reviews/2026-06-16-f-td-22-unique-usernames-review.md`; plan archived. Renames are not possible via the API, so create was the only entry point guarded.
- **Status:** ✅ DONE — shipped 2026-06-16, prod-healthy (preview 8/8 @critical · prod smoke 5/5 non-500 · ANVIL CLEARED unit 1722 / int 175 / pgTAP 66/66).

### F-TD-21 — `/api/auth/login` discloses an inactive account before checking the credential

- **Logged:** 2026-06-16 (F-13 PR3 plan §8.6 / Guard — pre-existing, byte-identical preserved).
- **What:** login returns `403 Account is inactive` *before* verifying the password/PIN, so a wrong credential against a known-inactive account still reveals that the account exists and is disabled — a mild account-enumeration signal. Not introduced by PR3 (the re-point preserved it exactly).
- **Fix shape:** move the active-check to AFTER credential verification (or return a uniform `401` for inactive+wrong-credential) so an attacker can't distinguish "inactive" from "wrong credential". Small, route-local; pair it with a test asserting the timing/response is indistinguishable.
- **Priority:** LOW (mild enumeration; requires knowing a real inactive username).
- **Status:** open.

### F-TD-16 — Two 🔵 residuals from the F-TD-09 Guard review (cron auth + comment accuracy)

- **Deferred:** 2026-06-14 (F-TD-09 Guard, both non-blocking 🔵)
- **What:** (a) **CRON_SECRET-unset hardening** — both cron routes (`app/api/cron/purge-idempotency-keys/route.ts:17` and the pre-existing `app/api/cron/haccp-alarm/route.ts:66`) compare `Authorization` to `Bearer ${process.env.CRON_SECRET}`; if `CRON_SECRET` were ever unset, the literal `"Bearer undefined"` would authenticate. Vercel injects the secret in all envs so it's latent, not live — but an early-return 500 on `!process.env.CRON_SECRET` would fail closed regardless. (b) **W1 comment accuracy** — `lib/adapters/supabase/OrdersRepository.ts:395-398` comment says the guard deletes "against the same instant the row was read at"; the captured `now` is actually taken *before* the read (conservative clock — behaviour is correct, the wording oversells). Reword.
- **Why deferred:** both non-blocking nits surfaced at F-TD-09 Guard; not worth re-opening the shipped PR.
- **Detail:** `docs/reviews/2026-06-14-f-td-09-idempotency-key-hygiene-review.md` (🔵 findings)
- **Owner unit:** unscheduled (tiny — fold into any future Orders/cron touch)
- **Status:** open

### F-TD-17 — WebKit E2E flakiness on 2 `@critical` specs (harness, not app)

- **Deferred:** 2026-06-14 (F-TD-04 ANVIL, 🟡 non-blocking)
- **What:** On the **Mobile Safari / WebKit** Playwright project only, `01-order-place.spec.ts:38` and `02-picking-list-print.spec.ts:25` flake/fail (timing/locator), while passing clean on chromium. Error-context snapshots show the app fully rendered — a WebKit navigation/timing wobble, not a server error.
- **Why deferred:** provably pre-existing and unrelated to F-TD-04 (that PR touched no spec/config/env; same flows green on chromium). Not worth gating a clean refactor.
- **Fix idea:** add `retries` for the WebKit project in the Playwright config, or `test.fixme('@flaky …')`/`@flaky`-tag the two assertions. Also: the WebKit binary was missing locally and installed mid-run — cold dev-server + WebKit timing likely contributes.
- **Detail:** `docs/anvil/2026-06-14-f-td-04-lazy-supabase-client-cert.md` (Warnings section)
- **Owner unit:** unscheduled (E2E-harness hygiene)
- **Status:** open

## Infrastructure follow-ups (F-INFRA-)

### F-INFRA-03 — Run the preview smoke in CI (GitHub Actions)

- **Deferred:** 2026-06-10 (during F-INFRA-02)
- **What:** The Gate-4 preview smoke is conductor-run from a local machine (`npm run test:e2e:preview -- <preview-url>`). Future unit: run it in CI (GitHub Actions) instead of / in addition to conductor-run, so every PR gets the smoke automatically. The Vercel Protection Bypass secret moves from `.env.e2e.local` to repo secrets; `.github/workflows/` is currently intentionally empty.
- **Why deferred:** Gate-1 lock for F-INFRA-02 explicitly scoped the smoke as FORGE-run with no CI.
- **Detail:** `docs/plans/2026-06-10-f-infra-02-preview-smoke-plumbing.md` + ADR-0006
- **Owner unit:** F-INFRA-03 (unscheduled)
- **Status:** open

### F-INFRA-04 — Re-enable Vercel Deployment Protection (+ automation bypass) after the re-architecture

- **Deferred:** 2026-06-10 (during F-INFRA-02)
- **What:** Deployment Protection is disabled entirely on the Vercel project because Hakan's plan exposed no usable Protection Bypass for Automation; previews are publicly URL-reachable (low risk: post-F-INFRA-02 previews hold only ANVIL-TEST dummy data). The preview smoke runs with the `--unprotected` flag in the meantime.
- **Goal:** when the migration completes (or if previews ever carry sensitive data), re-enable protection, generate the bypass secret into `.env.e2e.local` as `VERCEL_AUTOMATION_BYPASS_SECRET`, and drop the `--unprotected` flag from the Gate-4 runbook invocation.
- **Detail:** `docs/runbooks/preview-smoke.md` "Two modes" + ADR-0006 addendum
- **Owner unit:** unscheduled (post-migration ops)
- **Status:** open

### F-INFRA-05 — Supabase→Vercel preview-branch credential sync  ✅ SHIPPED (2026-06-15, PR #41 / `472d3f5`)

- **Surfaced:** 2026-06-14 (during F-RLS-03 ANVIL Lock, PR #38)
- **What:** The Supabase↔Vercel integration shows **connected on both sides** but injects **no** Supabase credentials into the Vercel **Preview** scope. A preview deploy therefore has zero DB creds (all prod Supabase vars are correctly Production-only per ADR-0006), so `createClient` throws and every route 500s; the Gate-4 preview smoke fails closed at the DB-identity probe. **Ruled out:** the timing race (deploy built before the Supabase branch existed) — a clean redeploy *after* the branch was healthy still 500'd. So the integration's preview env-var sync is genuinely not running/writing.
- **Stopgap used on F-RLS-03:** manual env bridge — added the PR branch's own keys (`NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`) to Vercel Preview scope, restricted to the git branch (branch keys, never prod). Smoke then went 8/8. This is a **per-PR manual chore** — not sustainable.
- **Why it must be fixed before F-RLS-04a:** F-RLS-04a flips real Orders routes onto the authenticated client (NOT inert) and genuinely needs a working preview smoke to prove RLS doesn't break Orders. Also: F-RLS-04a needs `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET` on preview, which a working integration would sync automatically (the prod set includes it).
- **Investigate:** Supabase dashboard → Integrations → Vercel sync config (only Preview + `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix was observed enabled — confirm which vars/scopes actually sync, incl. the server-only `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`); consider re-install/re-authorize of the integration; confirm whether it writes project-level Preview env vars or per-deployment injection.
- **Detail:** ADR-0006 (per-PR preview branches), `docs/runbooks/preview-smoke.md`, cert `docs/anvil/2026-06-14-f-rls-03-authenticated-db-client-cert.md` (E2E section)
- **Owner unit:** F-INFRA-05 — **schedule before F-RLS-04a (Day 4)**
- **Fix shipping:** an owned GitHub Action now does the sync automatically — `.github/workflows/preview-cred-sync.yml` + `scripts/preview-cred-sync*` (pure core + injected Supabase/Vercel I/O clients), runbook `docs/runbooks/preview-cred-sync.md`, plan `docs/plans/2026-06-15-f-infra-05-preview-cred-sync.md`. Writes the 4 branch-scoped Preview vars idempotently on PR open/sync/reopen + conditional redeploy, deletes them on PR close. Manual env bridge retired. Zero new deps.
- **Status:** ✅ **SHIPPED 2026-06-15** (PR #41 / `472d3f5`; supersedes closed #39). Live acceptance proven on PR #41's fresh 14-digit preview branch (`imrobmcrjicmrgxawlza`, run `27555331185`): branch-health poll → 3 Preview-scoped branch-scoped creds synced (redacted) → JWT warn-and-continue → redeploy fired → Vercel `dpl_G1g6…` came up `READY` as **Preview** (not prod). Took 3 live runs (HTTP-400 redeploy bug → fixed; eu-west-2 outage timeout → external; green on #41 after rebasing onto F-TD-15's 14-digit migrations + fresh-provisioning). Cert `docs/anvil/2026-06-15-f-infra-05-preview-cred-sync-cert.md`; review `docs/reviews/2026-06-15-f-infra-05-preview-cred-sync-review.md`. CI tooling only — no app code, no deps, no migration.
  - **⚠️ Residual → F-RLS-04a (NOT solved here):** the Supabase **Management API does NOT return `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET`** for a branch (asymmetric-key migration), so F-RLS-04a's preview-JWT need must be sourced another way (mechanism undecided). The 3-key path + loud warning is the defined fallback.
  - **🔵 follow-up:** confirm the `closed`-event cleanup fully deletes the branch-scoped Preview vars (run #41 showed `created:0, updated:3` → the #39-close cleanup left vars that #41 overwrote; benign, idempotent).

## RLS track follow-ups (F-RLS-)

### F-RLS-04a-print-guard — Enforce order-stage transition integrity (print-before-complete) for ALL roles

- **Logged:** 2026-06-15 (F-RLS-04a Guard delta re-review; conductor+Hakan accepted the gap as low-severity)
- **What:** the Orders UPDATE policies gate by role + pre-image state, but Postgres OR's permissive policies independently on USING (row visibility) and WITH CHECK (new row). Result: a role that can *see* a `placed` row for UPDATE can drive it straight to `completed` (skip print), because `orders_update_printed`'s WITH CHECK accepts `completed`. Confirmed live for **warehouse** (newly, via F-RLS-04a's `orders_print_placed`) AND pre-existing for **office/admin** (already in `orders_update_placed` + the loose printed WITH CHECK).
- **Severity:** LOW — workflow/state-machine looseness, NOT authorization or data exposure. Not reachable through app code (the app only does placed→printed→completed); requires a hand-crafted authenticated DB call with a valid session. Warehouse completing orders is legitimate; only the *skip-print* shortcut is at issue.
- **Fix:** restructure the order-stage UPDATE policies so each transition pins its pre-image — e.g. split `orders_update_printed` into an explicit `printed→completed` policy with `USING state='printed'` so a `placed` row can never satisfy the completed path. Do it **uniformly for all roles** (warehouse, office, admin) in one migration — NOT bolted onto one role. Add regression tests: each role can only advance one stage at a time.
- **Why deferred from F-RLS-04a:** doing it there meant restructuring a pre-existing policy + retesting office/admin completion flows = scope creep on a clean cutover. Better as a focused state-machine-integrity unit.

### F-RLS-04a-create — Cut `POST /api/orders` (create) onto RLS (deferred from F-RLS-04a)

- **Logged:** 2026-06-15 (F-RLS-04a Gate 2)
- **What:** order creation stays on the service-role client in F-RLS-04a because it's atomically coupled to `order_idempotency_keys` (RLS-on, deny-all, no policy — kept service-role). You can't split one transaction across the authenticated + service-role clients.
- **Fix options:** give `order_idempotency_keys` a policy so the whole create flow can run on the authenticated client, OR redesign the idempotency write so the order insert (authenticated) and the key write (service-role) aren't in one transaction. Needs design.
- **Note:** until done, Orders expand-contract steps 5–6 (remove the service-role fallback) cannot fully complete (create + KDS still need it).

### F-RLS-04a-kds — Cut the KDS routes onto RLS (carved out of F-RLS-04a)

- **Carved:** 2026-06-15 (F-RLS-04a FORGE Frame / grill)
- **What:** F-RLS-04a flips only the **front-door** Orders routes (`/api/orders`, `/api/orders/[id]`, `/api/orders/[id]/picking-list`) onto the authenticated DB client. The **KDS routes** — `/api/kds/orders` (public kiosk read) and `/api/kds/lines/[lineId]/done` (line-done write) — were carved out: they use a **side-door identity** (public at middleware; the worker's `butcher_id` arrives in the request body and is validated via the Users port, NOT the standard `mfs_session` / `x-mfs-user-*` headers). The session-minted authenticated client can't feed them without a different identity bridge.
- **Work needed:** thread the validated `butcher_id` into `app.current_user_id` for the KDS path (set the GUC on the request, or mint a token from the validated butcher) so KDS reads/writes can run on the authenticated client under the existing `orders`/`order_lines` policies. Decide the KDS read model too (a public kiosk read with no user → the GUC policy would deny; may need to keep the read on service-role or define a kiosk policy).
- **Also closes — KDS audit-attribution gap:** because KDS line-done stays service-role with no session GUC, KDS "done" taps currently record a **NULL user** in `order_audit_log` (the busiest Orders mutation). Cutting KDS over fixes attribution.
- **⚠️ Blocks Orders cleanup:** until this lands, F-RLS-04a expand-contract **steps 5–6 (remove the Orders service-role fallback)** cannot fully complete — the KDS path still needs service-role.
- **Schedule:** after F-RLS-04a proves out in prod. Tracked in the roadmap under Day-4's F-RLS-04a block.

## Product features (F-PROD-)

### F-PROD-01 — HACCP Allergen Assessment version history UI

- **Deferred:** before 2026-06-09
- **What:** `haccp_allergen_assessment` table stores each save as a new row (audit trail exists in DB) but `/haccp/allergens` page only shows the latest. No UI to view past versions.
- **Fix shape:** same pattern as Food Fraud assessment.
- **Priority:** Medium — SALSA auditor may ask to see previous assessments.
- **Owner unit:** unscheduled
- **Status:** open

### F-PROD-02 — KDS line-done undo with confirmation

- **Deferred:** 2026-06-09 (during F-06 session)
- **What:** Today if a kitchen operator taps "done" by accident, second tap is idempotent (no-op) — no way to UNDO. Hakan flagged: should the second tap show a confirmation modal "Are you sure you want to undo?" and revert the line?
- **Why deferred:** would re-litigate F-05's port shape (`markLineUndone` method) + new `audit_log` type + service rules ("can you undo a line on a completed order? No."). Not a migration concern; needs its own product+plan cycle.
- **Detail:** memory `project_hexagonal_migration_progress.md` "Tracked product features"
- **Priority:** Low-Medium — annoyance not a safety issue
- **Owner unit:** unscheduled (product feature, post-Phase-1)
- **Status:** open

## F-08 hard prerequisites (carried forward from memory)

Not new entries — pointers. F-08 cannot ship until these are green:

1. **F-TD-03** (above) fixed — 23 broken Orders integration tests pass
2. **Playwright `@critical` suite must PASS at Gate 3** — not skipped, not deferred
3. **F-INFRA-02 shipped** — the per-PR preview smoke is live (`npm run test:e2e:preview`, `docs/runbooks/preview-smoke.md`); the manual click-through compensating control is no longer required

Owner unit for F-INFRA-02 itself: separate infra ticket, pre-F-08.
