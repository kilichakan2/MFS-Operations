# ANVIL Clearance Certificate

Date: 2026-06-14
App: MFS-Operations
Branch: f-12-llmextractor-port
PR: #37 (base main)

## Scope — what this certificate actually covers

F-12 is a **pure relocation, zero behaviour change**: the Anthropic AI call was
moved out of `app/api/admin/import/route.ts` into an `LLMExtractor` port
(`lib/ports/LLMExtractor.ts`), a `lib/adapters/anthropic/` adapter, a Fake
adapter (`lib/adapters/fake/LLMExtractor.ts`), and a composition root
(`lib/wiring/llm.ts`). Model `claude-sonnet-4-6`, forced tool-use, and both
entity types are unchanged. Non-destructive: NO DB migration, NO schema change.

🗣 In plain English: the AI call now lives behind a swappable socket (port) with
a real Anthropic plug and a pretend stand-in plug. What it does is identical; only
where the code sits changed. So this cert proves nothing broke, not that anything new works.

**Not run under the efficiency dial / deliberate scope boundaries:**
- **No test hits the real Anthropic API** — non-deterministic, costs money, needs
  a live key. Route + integration use the **Fake** adapter; the real adapter is
  unit-tested against a **mocked SDK**. This is intentional and approved at Gate 3.
  🗣 We never call the real AI in tests: it's slow, costs money, and gives a
  different answer each time. We test the wiring with a stand-in instead.
- **No new F-12 integration tests** — the integration layer is a regression-only
  re-run (122 baseline). F-12 adds no real-DB behaviour, so no new integration
  test was warranted.
- **DB/RLS (pgTAP):** N/A — no schema change.
- **Edge functions:** N/A — none in this change.

**Baseline characterisation pass?** No — this is a diff-driven matrix on a
focused relocation PR.

**Architecture rung (seam crossed):** ✅ The touched port (`LLMExtractor`) has a
domain/route-facing test running on an in-memory **Fake** adapter (no real SDK,
no network). No vendor SDK (`@anthropic-ai/sdk`) is imported outside
`lib/adapters/anthropic/` — enforced by ESLint (lint ✅) and pinned by
`tests/unit/lint/no-adapter-imports.test.ts`. The seam is real, not welded shut.

Preview deployment smoked: `dpl_8Z2rC8CEtuC71VMhLZUFZ5RaGALU` (state READY),
commit `2eade22`, URL
`https://mfs-operations-nbqdrkry0-hakan-kilics-projects-2c54f03f.vercel.app`
(branch alias `mfs-operations-git-f-12-l-f46f35-hakan-kilics-projects-2c54f03f.vercel.app`).

Iterations used: **0** — every layer passed on the first run. No test fixes made.

## Warnings (non-blocking)

- **F-TD-17 (known):** a WebKit/Mobile-Safari-only flake on 2 @critical specs is a
  harness issue, not the app. Chromium-only smokes never block ship. Not observed
  in this run (chromium 8/8 clean).

## Migration

**None.**
Rollback note: docs/anvil/2026-06-14-f-12-llmextractor-port-rollback.md
(code-only revert of PR #37; no data/migration to roll back).
PITR: **N/A — non-destructive** (no schema change, no data touched).

## Merge Sequence

1. No migration to push — skip `supabase db push`.
2. Merge PR #37 → Vercel auto-deploys.
3. Smoke test: 3 @critical Playwright paths against the production URL post-merge.

## Verdict

✅ CLEARED FOR PRODUCTION

(Conductor handles the Lock gate / ship with Hakan — the runner does not ship.)

## Production Ship Record

- **SHIPPED 2026-06-14.** PR #37 squash-merged to `main` as `e4b9740`, feature branch deleted.
- **Production deploy:** `dpl_6jTnDFchmJ96zEGm2ZNKJnGzydLM`, target=production, **READY** (~48s build), commit `e4b9740`, auto-promoted to `www.mfsops.com` + `mfsops.com`.
- **No migration / no PITR** (non-destructive).
- **Production smoke (post-deploy, www.mfsops.com):** all non-500, app healthy.
  - `GET /` → 307 (app alive, redirect to login)
  - `POST /api/auth/login` bogus → 400 (login route validates; untouched by F-12)
  - `POST /api/admin/import` no-auth → 307 (auth middleware redirect — identical to an
    untouched API route; no 500)
  - `GET /api/reference` → 307 (same middleware redirect; no 500)
  - Caveat (honest): the import route sits behind auth middleware, so an unauthenticated
    prod probe redirects (307) before reaching the handler — it cannot exercise the F-12
    handler directly, and an authenticated probe would hit the real Anthropic API (the
    deliberate scope boundary). The handler is proven on this exact commit by ANVIL
    (unit 1581, integration 122, preview 8/8 @critical). Prod confirms deploy health /
    no regression.
- **Baselines held:** tsc 0, lint 0, unit 1581, integration 122.
- **Rollback (if needed):** `vercel rollback` to the prior production deploy
  `dpl_AgUmW8v5ZXkYq1GohPaePsgy6afB` (F-10, `5393c33`); code-only, no data to restore.

✅ SHIPPED — CLEARED FOR PRODUCTION, live on www.mfsops.com.
